The following list of jokes are taken from Reader's Digest:


“This hotel stinks!” a guest complained when he showed up at the front desk to check out.  
“What’s wrong?” I asked.  
“I got no sleep.  Every 15 minutes this loud banging sound woke me up!”
I apologized for the noise and checked him out.  A few minutes later, a couple showed up.  
Again, I made the mistake of asking how their stay was.
“Terrible!” they said.  “The guy in the next room was snoring so loudly that we had to 
bang on the wall every 15 minutes to wake him up!”


My wife and I were watching the gorillas at the zoo when several of them charged 
at the enclosure fence, scattering the crowd, except for one elderly man. Later, my wife 
asked him how he had kept his composure. "I used to drive a school bus," he explained.

I've been hauling trash for years, so when the sign "Garbage" appeared on a trash can, 
I replaced it with my own note: "After 20 years on the job, I know garbage when I see it!" 
I emptied the can and left. The next week, a new note appeared on the same can: "Dear Professor 
Trash, the garbage can is the garbage!"

Three birds were trying to decide which direction to fly.
The first bird said, “My instincts tell me to go North.”
The second bird said, “My instincts tell me to go South.
The third bird said, “Well, my end stinks, but it doesn’t tell me anything!”
